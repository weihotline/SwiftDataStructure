## Implementation of Data Structures in Swift
I love data structure. Understanding data structure is always beneficial for software development. When it comes to performance, picking the correct data structure becomes more important. Feel free to contact me at <weihotline@gmail.com> if you like Swift and these implementations.

## Tips for writing simple swift script
<p>
1. make sure xcode is installed
<pre> <code>xcodebuild -version
</code></pre>
2. Swift is still in its early stages. When writing swiftcode, you probably still need objective-c syntax (e.g., NSDate).
<pre> <code> // in swift file
import Foundation
</code> </pre>
